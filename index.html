<h1 style="color:Tomato;">Who Am I?</H1>
<p>Dear admissions officer of ETBD</p>
<p>Hello, my name is <span>Jiahao Yu</span>. I'm from China, and after the summer I will be a sophomore student. For me, I am not like most boys. I like perfume, shopping and reading science fiction. Of course,I also have my fovorite sports, such as tennis. </p><style>span{color:DodgerBlue;}</style>
<h1 style="color:Tomato;">Why I Want to Enroll?</H1>
<p>We are now in an era of rapid technological development. All kinds of high-tech are emerging in an endless stream. Early exposure to these digital and emerging technologies will allow me to better integrate into society in the future and better connect with the world.</p>
<p>There has another reason for me to choose ETBD. When I was still in high school, I had already begun to make plans for my future major. Initially, I thought that a good major would enable graduates to find good jobs and make more money. But after entering university for almost a year, I think it is more important to choose a major that I am more interested in. During the four years of university, the major I chose must accompany us most of the time. If I choose a major that I am not interested in, then I will not be motivated to continue studying. Later, maybe I can't even get a diploma. Therefore, choosing a major that you are more interested in is far more important than choosing a high-paying major. This is why I choose ETBD.</p>
<h1 style="color:Tomato;">What Interests Me Most about Digital and Emerging Technology?</H1>
<p>Emerging technologies have created amazing tools and resources to make everyoneâ€™s most useful information within reach. And through today's technological changes, our lives will become easier, more convenient, and even more interesting.</p>
<p>It is not only the future development of emerging technology that attracts me, but the emerging technology itself is an interesting topic.</p>
<p>In the past, science and technology helped people liberate people from the endless and complicated labor for survival, so that people were no longer in the stage of solving their physiological needs. <span>The development of science and technology today is not to weaken people's sense of existence, but to enhance their sense of existence.</span>Emerging technologies have liberated the body, but also liberated the human mind. People can use emerging technologies to manage their bodies to avoid certain physical defects, unless these defects become aesthetic needs.</p><style>span{color:Aquamarine;}</style>
<p>It is also the ultra-high-density wisdom in quantum sensors, the stunning beauty hidden in mathematical formulas and program codes, the brilliant wisdom behind the design of artificial intelligence and the spectacular industrial level of technology that make me more interested in ETBD.</p>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Thank you for taking the time to read the text I wrote. I hope everything is well!</p>
