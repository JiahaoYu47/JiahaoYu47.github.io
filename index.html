<h1 style="color:Tomato;">Who Am I?</H1>
<p>Dear admissions officer of ETBD</p>
<p>Hello, my name is <span>Jiahao Yu</span>. I'm from China, and after the summer I will be a sophomore student. For me, I am not like most boys. I like perfume, shopping and reading science fiction. Of course,I also have my fovorite sports, such as tennis. </p><style>span{color:DodgerBlue;}</style>
<h1 style="color:Tomato;">Why I Want to Enroll?</H1>
<p>When I was still in high school, I had already started to make a plan for my future major. Initially, I thought that a good major would allow graduates to find good jobs and make more money. But after the freshman year, I think it is more important to choose a major that I am more interested in. In four years of university, the major of my choice has to accompany us most of the time. If I choose a major that I am not interested in, I will not have the motivation to continue learning. Later, maybe I can't even get the diploma. Without a college diploma, all high-paying jobs will be missed by me.
